Warning : Library cell has no output pins defined. [LBR-9]
        : Library cell 'ANTENNA' must have an output pin.
        : Add the missing output pin(s), then reload the library. Else the library cell will be marked as timing model i.e. unusable. Timing_model means that the cell does not have any defined function. If there is no output pin, Genus will mark library cell as unusable i.e. the attribute 'usable' will be marked to 'false' on the libcell. Therefore, the cell is not used for mapping and it will not be picked up from the library for synthesis. If you query the attribute 'unusable_reason' on the libcell; result will be: 'Library cell has no output pins.'Note: The message LBR-9 is only for the logical pins and not for the power_ground pins. Genus will depend upon the output function defined in the pin group (output pin) of the cell, to use it for mapping. The pg_pin will not have any function defined.
